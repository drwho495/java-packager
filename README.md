This is a GUI which allows you to create and upload packages!

### Downloading a package
To download a package you need to download the jar file, make a new directory, then make another dir that should be called "packages"

Run the jar file. Maximize window. Then search for a package (one package i have made is called express4java which is basically a web server.)

If you don't see any buttons popping up as you searched for a package, then unmaximize and maximize again.

press the button(s) to install the package

### Compiling

javac -cp packages/* <file(s)>
javac -cp packages/* <file(/s)>
